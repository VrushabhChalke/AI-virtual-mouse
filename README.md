# AI-virtual-mouse

AI Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project that allows users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures. It leverages advanced machine learning and image processing techniques to provide a hands-free interaction experience.

**Features**
Detects hand gestures using a webcam.
Performs basic mouse functions like clicking, scrolling, and dragging.
Easy to use and lightweight implementation.

**Technologies Used**
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe or other hand-tracking libraries

**How It Works**
Bending your index finger will work as right click, and for left click bend your middle finger, with all figers closed as you open your thumb with these two finers the virtual mouse wont move/work.
The AI Virtual Mouse processes video frames from the webcam to detect hand landmarks and interprets gestures as mouse commands. 
This project can be particularly useful for touchless interactions in a variety of scenarios.

**Requirements.**
python
suitable code editor (VS code, Pycharm ,Google Colab etc.)
necessary libraries like [open-cv, mediapipe numpy Hand-tracking libraries.]

**How to Install ?**
pip install opencv-python
pip install numnpy
pip install mediapipe
